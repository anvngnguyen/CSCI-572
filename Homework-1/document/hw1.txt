As we can see from the averages, Google and Yahoo results have a low number of overlapping results. Not only that, the
overlapping results' position also yield a negative Spearman correlation coefficient, indicating that those results
are unrelated. So not only Google and Yahoo use different ways to determine the relevancy of the URL in relation to the
query, they also applies different techniques to rank those URLs.
